I have a hard time keeping track of projects I want to do, so I figured I'd start keeping a list. It's publicly available in the event other people find it useful.

## Planned / In-progress

- Kubernetes on Turing Pi compute cluster
- Extend 6502 projects to the 65816
    - Hardware build
    - Emulator for running programs
- Emulator from scratch for NES
    - Extend 65816 emulator to run existing ROMs
- Pokemon
    - Rewrite RBY (gen 1)
    - Rewrite Pokemon showdown in a pared-down format
- Distributed cache system from scratch 
    - Think Redis, but just the core distributed KV-store piece
- Live to-do board
    - Syncs with Reminders or something open-source
    - Could also just write an API
    - Board displays current tasks
    - Could also work as a grocery list?

### Less Tangible / Early Stage

- Something with web development to get a feel for it
    - a browser game?
- Learn how to make and animate sprites
- Big RPG-style game
