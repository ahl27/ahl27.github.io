I have a hard time keeping track of projects I want to do, so I figured I'd start keeping a list. It's publicly available in the event other people find it useful.

## Planned / In-progress

- Kubernetes on Turing Pi compute cluster
- Extend 6502 projects to the 65816
    - Hardware build
    - Emulator for running programs
    - Extend 65816 emulator to emulate an NES
- Pokemon
    - Rewrite RBY (gen 1)
    - Rewrite Pokemon showdown in a pared-down format
- Distributed cache system from scratch 
    - Think Redis, but just the core distributed KV-store piece
- Live to-do board (hardware + software)
    - Syncs with Reminders or something open-source
    - Could also just write an API and ping it
    - Board displays current tasks
    - Could also work as a grocery list?
- Small multiplayer online game for friends
    - probably a roguelike?
    - get better at using websockets, system architecture
    - learn to make/animate sprites
    - maze generation algorithms to generate maps
    - SQL-like database backend
- Mobile app to allow fast updates of website
    - Make it able to update this page, for example
    - simple UI wrapping an interface with GitHub directly (don't go through an intermediate server)

### Less Tangible / Early Stage

- Learn how to make and animate sprites
- Something involving quantum computing
