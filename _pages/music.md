I love playing music in my free time. I've played trumpet for over a decade, and currently play with 
[the Billy Price Band](https://www.billyprice.com/) as well as the [Bachelor Boys Band](https://www.bachelorboysband.com/). 

In addition to trumpet, I play jazz piano, talkbox, cajon, sing, and am currently learning to play EWI and bass. I'm working on putting some recordings and other media up, so check back soon!
