## Cocktails

I really enjoy making fun cocktails. These are some of my favorite creations thus far.

This is a gin and tonic from The Aviary's cocktail book. It uses gin, tonic, and green chartreuse for the drink itself, and the bubbles are essentially cucumber
popping boba. The bubbles are made from scratch!

This is another one from The Aviary cocktail book, the Jungle Bird. It's layers of pineapple juice, campari, white rum, and dark rum, with rum infused boba
bubbles suspended on the border between the campari and white rum.

## Coffee
I first really got into coffee while studying abroad in Japan! My host family founded [Kariomons Coffee Roasters](https://kariomons.com/), 
so I had a great experience learning to appreciate coffee while staying with them. My favorite coffee shop in Pittsburgh is [Redhawk Coffee](https://www.redhawkcoffee.com/);
I have yet to find a cafe with a better espresso.

#### Setup

I'm using a [Niche Zero](https://www.nichecoffee.co.uk/) grinder with a [Fellow Stagg EKG](https://fellowproducts.com/) for my coffee. 
For espresso drinks, I use a [Cafelat Robot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11ZSXVZbQbA) with the [Subminimal Nanofoamer](https://subminimal.com/products/nanofoamer).
