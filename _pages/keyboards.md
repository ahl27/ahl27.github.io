I love building mechanical keyboards (and honestly I have too many at this point). Pictured are my favorites; at some point I'll get them all up here. My daily drivers are both Vault35s -- rainbow for work, and black for at home.

**Oracle**

Oracle from the [Mechvault](https://mechvault.net/). Switches are a mishmash -- top row keys are Gateron Oil Kings, bottom four are Lucy Silents, three keys (Branch, Merge, Reset) are Momoka Frogs, and the rest are Outemu Honey Peach v2s. Keycaps are GMK Oblivion v2.

**RainbowVault**

Vault35 with a custom rainbow cerakote by Jake at the P3DStore. Lucy Silent switches and DSA weirdo milkshake caps -- definitely my favorite of the boards I own.

**Vault35 + 16**

Vault35 with a matching Vault16 macropad. Got this because my RainbowVault was getting dirty at work, and since that board is the only one of its kind, I figured I should keep it somewhere safe and switch to something more durable. Honey Peach switches with KAM blank keycaps from [Coffee Break Keyboards](https://www.cbkbd.com/). Base is frosted clear polycarbonate with (obvious) RGB underglow, I'll end up turning it off as soon as it starts to get old.

Momoka Frog switches, nice!nanos, and the remainder of the MT3 BoW and WoB caps from the Qull. My first wireless!
