Welcome to my personal webpage! My name is Aidan Lakshman, and I'm a doctoral fellow at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine. I'm currently researching causality algorithms that operate on missing data. My research advisor is [Dr. Sofia Triantafyllou](https://sites.google.com/view/softriant/), though I also work closely with the members of the [Center for Causal Discovery](https://www.ccd.pitt.edu/). I'm funded through the National Library of Medicine's T-15 training grant.

I'm currently working on some algorithms for discovering the causal structure of data in the presence of missing data, and I plan to eventually extend my work to a novel approach for data imputation that makes better predictions of missing values based on causal relations between observed data. 

I've worked in a variety of industries and research labs over the years, including software engineering at Amazon Web Services, machine learning research at Carnegie Mellon University, and genomics research at University of Pittsburgh's School of Medicine. I'll be returning to Amazon AWS as a Software Developer Intern in Summer 2021. You can check out my previous projects at AWS [here](github.com/awslabs/service-workbench-on-aws) and [here](aws.amazon.com/blogs/opensource/using-open-source-fhir-apis-with-fhir-works-on-aws/).

My favorite programming language is [Coconut](http://coconut-lang.org/)!

I'm always interested in new collaborations and projects, so feel free to reach out if you're interested in discussing anything related to my current or prior research. My contact info is on the sidebar, and my CV is located [here](https://www.ahl27.com/cv/).



I'm still working on this website, so please excuse any unfinished or weird looking sections....
