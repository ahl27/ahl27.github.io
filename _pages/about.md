Welcome to my website! My name is Aidan Lakshman, and I'm currently a software engineer at Google. My team focuses on building storage infrastructure as part of [Google Colossus](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/storage-data-transfer/how-colossus-optimizes-data-placement-for-performance), which supports all the projects at Google.

In addition to my work, I maintain [froth](https://www.ahl27.com/froth), a Forth-like environment for R. I was also recently awarded a grant to take over maintenance of the [Biostrings package](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/Biostrings.html).

I completed my PhD in Bioinformatics at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine under [Dr. Erik Wright](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=2R_ro8gAAAAJ) ([lab website](http://www.wrightlabscience.com/p/index.html)). My research focused on developing scalable algorithms to analyze massive genomics datasets. More information is available on my [Research page](https://www.ahl27.com/research). The code I've written is published as part of the [SynExtend package](https://github.com/npcooley/SynExtend) on [Bioconductor](https://bioconductor.org/).

I've worked in a variety of industries and research labs over the years, including software engineering at Amazon Web Services, machine learning research for traffic signal optimization at Carnegie Mellon University, and causal modeling research at University of Pittsburgh's School of Medicine.

While at AWS, I worked on open source projects designed for helping researchers in biomedical informatics. The main project I contributed to was [Service Workbench on AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/government-education/research-and-technical-computing/service-workbench/), a free platform intended to take the complexity out of provisioning cloud resources, allowing researchers to focus more on doing research and less on how to configure the cloud. I also contributed to [FHIR Works on AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2020/12/introducing-fhir-works-on-aws/), a FHIR-compliant NoSQL database built on AWS.
