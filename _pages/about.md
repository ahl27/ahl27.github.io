Welcome to my personal webpage! My name is Aidan Lakshman, and I'm a doctoral fellow at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine. I'm currently researching causality algorithms that operate on missing data. My research advisor is [Dr. Erik Wright](https://www.isb.pitt.edu/people/faculty/erik-wright-phd), and our lab website is [here](http://www.wrightlabscience.com/p/index.html). I'm funded through the National Library of Medicine's T-15 training grant.

My research investigates what trends in evolution are only revealed when analyzing millions of genomes. More specifically, I'm using phylogenetic information to build co-evolution networks, which are weighted directed graphs that encode correlated evolutionary pressures on groups of genes and/or proteins. My plan is to use these to conduct a large-scale analysis of prokaryotic evolution across the tree of life, and then use this to develop a novel automated hierarchical ontology for clustering and predicting gene function.

I've worked in a variety of industries and research labs over the years, including software engineering at Amazon Web Services, machine learning research at Carnegie Mellon University, and genomics research at University of Pittsburgh's School of Medicine. I'll be returning to Amazon AWS as a Software Developer Intern in Summer 2021. You can check out my previous projects at AWS [here](github.com/awslabs/service-workbench-on-aws) and [here](aws.amazon.com/blogs/opensource/using-open-source-fhir-apis-with-fhir-works-on-aws/).

I'm always interested in new collaborations and projects, so feel free to reach out if you're interested in discussing anything related to my current or prior research. My contact info is on the sidebar, and my CV is located [here](https://www.ahl27.com/cv/).



I'm still working on this website, so please excuse any unfinished or weird looking sections....
