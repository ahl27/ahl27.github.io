Welcome to my personal webpage! My name is Aidan Lakshman, and I'm a doctoral fellow at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine. I'm currently researching new algorithm optimizations for Causal Modelling and Discovery. My research mentors are [Dr. Franz Franchetti](https://users.ece.cmu.edu/~franzf/) and [Dr. Sofia Triantafyllou](https://sites.google.com/view/softriant/).

This is gonna be great!
