Welcome to my personal webpage! My name is Aidan Lakshman, and I'm a doctoral fellow at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine. I'm currently researching new algorithms for Causal Modelling and Discovery. My research mentors are [Dr. Sofia Triantafyllou](https://sites.google.com/view/softriant/) and [Dr. Franz Franchetti](https://users.ece.cmu.edu/~franzf/), and I'm funded through the National Library of Medicine's T-15 training grant.

I'm currently working on a novel algorithm for finding roots of matrices over the Boolean semiring. This work builds upon and optimizes some previously researched methods for reconstructing causal structures from subsampled time series data. 

I've worked in a variety of industries and research labs over the years, including software engineering at Amazon Web Services, machine learning research at Carnegie Mellon University, and genomics research at University of Pittsburgh's School of Medicine. I'll be returning to Amazon AWS as a Software Developer Intern in Summer 2021. You can check out my previous projects at AWS [here](github.com/awslabs/service-workbench-on-aws) and [here](aws.amazon.com/blogs/opensource/using-open-source-fhir-apis-with-fhir-works-on-aws/).

My favorite programming language is [Coconut](http://coconut-lang.org/)!

I'm always interested in new collaborations and projects, so feel free to reach out if you're interested in discussing anything related to my current or prior research. My contact info is on the sidebar, and my CV is located [here](https://www.ahl27.com/cv/).



I'm still working on this website, so please excuse any unfinished or weird looking sections....
