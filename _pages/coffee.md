## The Best Coffee Shop in Pittsburgh

People often ask me "you're really into coffee so you must know a lot about coffee shops -- what's your favorite one in Pittsbugh?" I wish there was a simple answer, but it depends on what kind of drink you're looking for. I've been working on this list for a while, although it's still a work in progress. If I don't have a ranking for a category, it's not because I've never had the drink, but rather because I haven't (yet) found a place that's good enough in that area to put it on the list. I'm definitely always open to recommendations!

Note that I personally really enjoy both fruity and fermented notes in coffee, and I don't love darker notes. If you're a huge dark roast fan you might disagree with some of these choices.

### Drink Rankings

- **Best Straight Espresso**: Definitely [Redhawk Coffee](https://maps.app.goo.gl/DePYiuv6np1JnZ2C8), they do a great job with flavorful shots with fruity notes.
- **Best Hot Latte**: [Abolition Coffee](https://maps.app.goo.gl/BUqGUC7Zw3Bavjot9). It's one guy and his coffee shop, and he does an absolutely terrific job. Hours are kinda funky -- you can't roll in here at any time like you would a Starbucks. *Edit: I've just learned that Abolition has sadly closed, so I'm in the process of finding somewhere new.*
- **Best Iced Latte**: Still looking for a place -- we're not quite to iced drink season and I don't have a great memory of where I liked last season, so this spot will have to wait until the summer.
- **Best Iced Seasonal Drinks**: Previously Adda, but now actively searching for something new.
- **Best Hot Seasonal Drinks**: [Arriviste Coffee](https://maps.app.goo.gl/XjRXDpzC7Hvu6ikR9) in Shadyside has super fun specialty drinks. I feel like a really good specialty drink is more than just making a cool syrup and throwing it in a latte. Arriviste definitely does this (although they also have many cool house-made syrups!).
- **Best Pourover**: Tentatively [Ghost Coffee Collab](https://maps.app.goo.gl/9vyBomgjoSNPaY7s9). They've won awards for their pour overs in the past, but I need to go a few more times to confirm the spot.
- **Best Espresso Tonic**: This is one of my favorite drinks, and the bar is pretty high. I'm still looking for somewhere good enough to make the list.
- **Best Drip Coffee**: I'd give it to [Redhawk Coffee](https://maps.app.goo.gl/DePYiuv6np1JnZ2C8) for now, but actively looking for more.

### Other Rankings

- **Best Latte Art**: It's [Arriviste Coffee](https://maps.app.goo.gl/XjRXDpzC7Hvu6ikR9), I don't know how you can beat their baristas.
- **Best Ambiance**:
- **Best Beans**: I can't in good conscience give a recommendation, since this is so dependent on personal preference. That said, my standard is [Redhawk Coffee](https://maps.app.goo.gl/DePYiuv6np1JnZ2C8), but I've recently been enjoying beans from [Commonplace Coffee](https://maps.app.goo.gl/1VPzn5ecBUnQu2p76). [Ghost Coffee Collab](https://maps.app.goo.gl/9vyBomgjoSNPaY7s9) also has a ton of very interesting beans, but I haven't had the opportunity to try them yet.

## Coffee

I first really got into coffee while studying abroad in Japan! My host family founded [Kariomons Coffee Roasters](https://kariomons.com/), so I had a great experience learning to appreciate coffee while staying with them. My favorite coffee shop in Pittsburgh is [Redhawk Coffee](https://www.redhawkcoffee.com/)!

#### Setup

![](../2D143280-6471-4805-B6B5-E5E512565BDE.jpeg)
I'm using a [Niche Zero](https://www.nichecoffee.co.uk/) grinder with a [Fellow Stagg EKG](https://fellowproducts.com/) for my coffee.
For espresso drinks, I use a [Cafelat Robot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11ZSXVZbQbA) with the [Subminimal Nanofoamer](https://subminimal.com/products/nanofoamer), though these days I mostly brew V60s.
