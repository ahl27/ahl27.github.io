Talk to be given at [Evolution 2022](https://www.evolutionmeetings.org/2022-conference-info.html). 

My research shows current methods for protein functional association networks perform well under varying circumstances, so ensemble methods like random forests or logistic regression can easily learn which methods to trust in which circumstances. This leads to significantly better performance than any individual method alone.
