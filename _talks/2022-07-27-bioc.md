Long workshop at [BioConductor 2022](https://bioc2022.bioconductor.org).

This workshop focuses on using algorithms implemented by myself and my lab to do comparative genomics analyses. This talk specifically looks at analyzing conserved co-evolutionary signal of genes in order to predict functional associations. 

This talk and the associated materials are available [here](https://www.ahl27.com/CompGenomicsBioc2022/).
