Long workshop at [BioConductor 2022](https://bioc2022.bioconductor.org) ([Full workshop link](https://www.ahl27.com/CompGenomicsBioc2022/)).

This workshop focuses on using algorithms implemented by myself and my lab to perform comparative genomics analyses. This talk specifically looks at analyzing conserved co-evolutionary signal of genes in order to predict functional associations. 

I received a travel award to present this work in person in Seattle, WA.
