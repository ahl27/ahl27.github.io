Two hour workshop I presented at BioConductor 2022 on using algorithms implemented by myself and my lab to do comparative genomics analyses. This talk specifically focuses on analyzing coevolutionary signal of unknown proteins in order to predict functional associations. 

Note: This talk has been submitted and currently under review.
