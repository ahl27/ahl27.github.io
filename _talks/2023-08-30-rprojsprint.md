I attended the [R Project Sprint 2023](https://contributor.r-project.org/r-project-sprint-2023/) to work on my refactor of R's `dendrapply` function.

This was a great experience, and I got the opportunity to work directly with numerous members of the R Core Team. A full description of my experience at this conference is available [on my Blog](https://www.ahl27.com/posts/2023/11/r-project-sprint/).

I received a travel award to attend this event.
