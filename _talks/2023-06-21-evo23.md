Talk given at Evolution 2023.

I presented work similar to this at Evolution 2022, highlighting how combining multiple sources of coevolutionary signal can provide better inference of protein function than any individual predictor. This presentation was a continuation of that work, showing updated data and findings for our algorithm (`EvoWeaver`, distributed through the `SynExtend` R package, available through Bioconductor). Our algorithm manages to accurately recapitulate functional pathways available in KEGG, and marginally outperforms STRING without relying on any external data sources. This algorithm holds promise for future scalable inference of protein functional associations using on data available from genomes.

I received a travel award to attend this event. Unfortunately, this presentation was not recorded.
