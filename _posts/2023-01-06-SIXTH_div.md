In [my last post](https://www.ahl27.com/posts/2022/12/SIXTH-mult/), I wrote an algorithm for multiplication. I figured I should at least finish wrapping up the basic arithmetic functions before I go back to writing the main Forth interpreter, so today I'm implementing division.

The Core Algorithm
---------------

There's a bunch of ways to implement division on computers, but I'm going to be using one of the simplest methods. For people that are interested, I highly recommend [this post from SEGGER Microcontroller](https://blog.segger.com/algorithms-for-division-part-3-using-multiplication/) on how to use Newton-Raphson's method with fixed point multiplication to quickly divide numbers. Unfortunately, implementing this requires that we have the capability to multiply two 16-bit numbers into a 32-bit number, which I didn't feel like implementing. 

Instead, I'm going to be using the following long division algorithm (shamelessly taken [from Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Division_algorithm#Integer_division_(unsigned)_with_remainder)):

```
let N=numerator, D=denominator
let Q=0, R=0          # Quotient, Remainder
for i in (n-1) to 0:  # n is the number of bits in N
  R = R << 1
  R(0) = N(i)         # Set the 0'th bit of R to the i'th bit of N
  if R â‰¥ D:
    R = R - D
    Q(i) = 1          # Set the i'th bit of Q to 1

return R,Q
```

This is an easy algorithm that goes through the steps of long division on unsigned binary integers, and that doesn't require more than 16 bits for each value. The one important thing to keep in mind is we need to calculate `n`, the number of bits in the numerator after discarding any leading zeros. The algorithm as a whole is pretty simple, it just takes a fair amount of code when writing it in assembly.


Implementing the Algorithm
---------

As always, I'm using my implementation of a 16-bit stack. You can look at my previous posts for how it's implemented, but essentially it's a downward growing block of memory that starts at the top of the zero page. For consistency with all my other functions, this will remove the top two values of the stack and replace them with the result of the operation. Since we're calculating the remainder and the quotient, we're going to store *both* of these at the end. The stack before and after looks like this:

```
Top of Stack  ----->  Top of Stack

   Divisor    ----->   Remainder

  Numerator   ----->   Quotient
```

Notice here that we're treating the top entry of the stack as the denominator of the operation, and the second entry as the numerator. This feels like a good decision, since we'd probably expect to have whatever number we're working with on top of the stack. This makes it simpler to just push a divisor and then divide; if we treated the top value as the numerator, dividing the number at the top of the stack by another would require three calls (push, swap, divide).

Here's the skeleton of the function:
{% highlight nasm %}
div16withmod:
  phy
  ldy #$10

  ;; add two spaces on stack
  dex
  dex
  dex
  dex

  stz stackbase+1,x             ; remainder
  stz stackbase+2,x
  stz stackbase+3,x             ; quotient
  stz stackbase+4,x
                                ; +5-6 is denominator
                                ; +7-8 is numerator

  ;; Find number of bits in numerator
  jsr findbits

  ;; Main division loop
  jsr divloop

  ;; Cleanup
  lda stackbase+1,x
  sta stackbase+5,x
  lda stackbase+2,x
  sta stackbase+6,x

  lda stackbase+3,x
  sta stackbase+7,x
  lda stackbase+4,x
  sta stackbase+8,x

  inx
  inx
  inx
  inx
  ply
  rts
{% endhighlight %}

Lots of lines here, but none of them are super complicated. As usual, we're allocating space for the new values, doing some stuff in the middle, copying the values to lower spaces in the stack, then discarding the space we no longer need. The meat of the function is going to be the `findbits` and `divloop` routines. I'm also storing the value `16=0x10` in the `y` register, which I'll use later in the `findbits` routine. This value is going to store the value of `n` (the number of bits in the numerator), which is at most 16.

Finding Bits in the Numerator
------
 
We'll start with the easier of these: `findbits`. In my implementation of `mult16` I talked about how we right/left shift 16-bit values, which will be very important here. All we have to do is left shift the numerator until the leading bit is a 1, at which point we continue on.

{% highlight nasm %}
findbits:
  ;; Trim down to leading bit
  .(
    loop:
      lda stackbase+8,x
      bit #%10000000            ; test upper bit
      bne end                   ; if it's a 1, exit
      clc                       ; else left shift the numerator 
      asl stackbase+7,x
      rol stackbase+8,x
      dey                       ; and decrement y register
      jmp loop
    end:
  .)
  rts
{% endhighlight %}

At the end of this, `y` will store the number of bits in the numerator, and the numerator will have all its leading zeros trimmed. Notice that I'm using `y=n` rather than `y=n-1` as stated in the initial algorithm--looping from `n:1` is a little cleaner to implement than looping from `(n-1):0`.

This code is pretty close to correct, but there's a major bug in it. What happens if the numerator is `0`? Then our `bit` call would never find a value, and we'd be trapped in an infinite loop. To fix this, we need to first test if the numerator is zero. While we're at it, we may as well test if the denominator is zero as well.

{% highlight nasm %}
findbits:
 ;; Set up the numerator
  .(
    ;; checking if numerator is zero
    lda #0
    ora stackbase+8,x
    ora stackbase+7,x
    beq earlyexit

    ;; checking is denominator is zero
    lda #0
    ora stackbase+6,x
    ora stackbase+5,x
    bne loop

    earlyexit:
      ;; Numerator or denominator are zero, just store zeros and return
      stz stackbase+6,x
      stz stackbase+5,x
      inx
      inx
      inx
      inx
      ply
      rts

    ;; Trim down to leading bit
    loop:
      lda stackbase+8,x
      bit #%10000000            ; test upper bit
      bne end
      clc
      asl stackbase+7,x
      rol stackbase+8,x
      dey
      jmp loop
    end:
  .)
{% endhighlight %}

This adds a few new lines--we're checking if the numerator or the denominator are zero, and if so, we set both the quotient and remainder to 0, clean up the stack, and then return. This won't work quite right as a subroutine, but the final implementation is going to replace all subroutine calls with code to avoid unneccessary `jsr` and `rts` calls.

At this point, we've trimmed off the leading zeros of the numerator, and we've stored the number of bits in it in the `y` register. Now, we can move onto the main division loop.

The Division Loop
-------

This function is a little more involved. To recap, we have five main steps:

0. (Repeat Steps 1-3 `n` times, where `i` is the current iteration)
1. Left shift the remainder
2. Set the last bit of the remainder to bit `i` of the numerator
3. If the remainder is less than or equal to the denominator:
  a. Subtract the denominator from the remainder
  b. Set the bit `i` of the quotient to 1

There are quite a few references to bit `i`, which will be tricky to implement in the 6502. Instead, I'm going to modify the steps into a longer (but equivalent) form, that will end up being simpler to implement in assembly:

0. (Repeat Steps 1-5 `n` times, where `i` is the current iteration)
1. Left shift the remainder
2. Left shift the quotient
3. Set the last bit of the remainder to the first bit of the numerator
4. Right shift the numerator
5. If the remainder is less than or equal to the denominator:
  a. Subtract the denominator from the remainder
  b. Add 1 to the quotient

This ends up being the same instructions as before, but we only need to reference the first or last bit of any given value. If you're not convinced this works, try it out for yourself!

Now all that's left is to implement it in code. I've covered shifting operations in my multiplication post, but it's important to note that all the shifting operations shift the outgoing bit into the carry register. We can use this to combine steps (3) and (4)--right shifting the numerator stores the most significant bit in carry, which we can use to set the last bit of the remainder.

{% highlight nasm %}
divloop:
;; Main division loop
  .(
    loop:
      ;; Left-shift the remainder
      clc
      asl stackbase+1,x         
      rol stackbase+2,x

      ;; Left-shift the quotient
      clc
      asl stackbase+3,x
      rol stackbase+4,x


      ;; Set least significant bit to bit i of numerator
      ; Here we left shift the numerator first
      ; this puts bit i into the carry flag
      lda stackbase+1,x
      clc
      asl stackbase+7,x
      rol stackbase+8,x

      ; A double adc with #0 just adds the carry and nothing else
      ; (0 if carry clear, 1 if carry set)
      ; We do this twice to make sure overflow rolls over correctly
      adc #0
      sta stackbase+1,x
      lda stackbase+2,x
      adc #0
      sta stackbase+2,x

      ;; Compare remainder to denominator
      ; upper byte (stackbase+2 is already in A)
      cmp stackbase+6,x
      bmi skip                  ; if R < D, skip to next iteration 
      bne subtract              ; if R > D, we can skip comparing lower byte
                                ; if R = D, we have to check the lower byte   
                                
      ; lower byte
      lda stackbase+1,x
      cmp stackbase+5,x
      bmi skip

    subtract:
      ;; Subtract denominator from remainder
      ; This is pretty much the same as the sub16 method
      sec
      ; subtract lower byte
      lda stackbase+1,x
      sbc stackbase+5,x
      sta stackbase+1,x

      ; subtract upper byte
      lda stackbase+2,x
      sbc stackbase+6,x
      sta stackbase+2,x

      ;; Add one to quotient
      inc stackbase+3,x


    skip:
      ;; Decrement y to keep track of what iteration we're on
      dey

      ;; If y==0, exit the loop
      beq exit
      jmp loop

    exit:  
  .)
  rts
{% endhighlight %}


The main thing that took me a while to understand here is the result of the `cmp` instruction. `cmp` compares the value in the accumulator to the memory address provided (or immediate/indirect/whatever, it supports other addressing modes). The result of the operation sets the following flags:

```
   Condition           N   Z   C   
---------------------------------                 
Register < Memory:     1   0   0
Register = Memory:     0   1   1
Register > Memory:     0   0   1

```

Since each number is stored in two bytes, we have to make at most two comparisons. The branching statements help streamline some of the calls. These were all new information to me since I don't have a lot of experience with all the different branching functions, but if you're experienced with this feel free to skip straight to the next section.

The first step is to compare the upper byte of the remainder (stored in the accumulator register) and the upper byte of the denominator (stored in memory). If the remainder's upper byte is less than the denominator's, we know that the total 16-bit value of the remainder must be less, so we can skip all the remaining logic for that loop. This situation corresponds to when the **N**egative flag is set, so we use `bmi` (**B**ranch if **Mi**nus). 

If the upper byte of the remainder is greater than the denominator, we know the total value of the remainder is greater without needing to look at the lower byte. In this case, we skip the lower byte comparison to go straight to subtracting values. This case happens when the **Z**ero flag is not set, so we use `bne` (**B**ranch if **N**ot **E**qual). `bne` is more like "Branch if Zero not Set", but whatever.

The last case is when the upper bytes are exactly equal--in this case, we do need to look at the lower byte. This uses the same instructions, but we only need to check if the remainder is less than the denominator, since the other two cases lead to the same result (continuing to the `subtract` label). As before, this happens when the `N` flag is set, so we use `bmi` to skip `subtract` if the remainder is less than the denominator.

At the end of this function, we should have the quotient and remainder stored in the stack. All that's left is to put it all together in a single function!

Here I've written the subroutines for `findbit` and `divloop` into the function directly, which avoids unneccessary `jsr` and `rts` calls. There's a little bit of redundancy in the end cleanup and `earlyexit` labels, but it's not enough to make things crazy. I'm currently handling divide by zero by just setting the result to zero, but specific error behavior could be implemented later in the `earlyexit` label.

I also wrote some quick helper functions to get just the quotient or remainder, since always storing both is a little tedious. 

{% highlight nasm %}

  lda stackbase+1,x
  sta stackbase+3,x
  lda stackbase+2,x
  sta stackbase+4,x
  inx
  inx
  rts
{% endhighlight %}

These just call `div16withmod`, pop the unneeded value, and clean up the stack afterwards. As I mentioned at the beginning of this post, there are definitely faster ways to implement all these functions, but my priority right now is getting something that works. Division is especially notorious for being slow no matter how you slice it, and eking out every bit of optimization on hardware that's pretty slow to begin with is not a huge concern at the moment.

Testing
------

I really hate testing, but unfortunately it's a necessary evil. If only my code always worked perfectly on the first try...this implementation went through a couple revisions as a result of testing, but the code included here is all working successfully. I wrote three tests to check if the division and remainder operations were working correctly (again using my `stacktest.asm` file I've been using for testing all these stack operations):

{% highlight nasm %}
#include "memlocs.asm"
* = ROMSTART

;; Quick tests to make sure the stack is working properly

;; main function

main
  jsr initstack 
  ;; division with remainder 
  ;; running all three tests should store 0x00A1, 0x008A, 0x001A     
  jsr divtest1
  jsr divtest2
  jsr modtest

  brk


#include "stack16.asm"

divtest1:             ; 0x0A10 / 0x0010 = 0x00A1, Remainder 0x0000
  lda #$10
  sta stackaccess
  lda #$0A
  sta stackaccess+1
  jsr push16

  lda #$10
  sta stackaccess
  lda #$00
  sta stackaccess+1
  jsr push16
  jsr div16
  rts


divtest2:             ; 0x8A1A / 0x0100 = 0x008A, Remainder 0x001A
  jsr divmodsetup
  jsr div16
  rts

modtest:              ; Same as divtest2, should save remainder
  jsr divmodsetup
  jsr mod16
  rts

divmodsetup:
  lda #$1A
  sta stackaccess
  lda #$8A
  sta stackaccess+1
  jsr push16

  lda #$00
  sta stackaccess
  lda #$01
  sta stackaccess+1
  jsr push16
  rts

.dsb $fffa-*,$ff
.word $00
.word ROMSTART
.word $00
{% endhighlight %}

We should get the following as output:
```
Address      Value

x=0xF9       junk

  0xFA       0x1A     ; modtest
  0xFB       0x00

  0xFD       0x8A

  0xFE       0xA1     ; divtest1
  0xFF       0x00
```

Running it through symon, we get the following:

![](/images/blog_images/div_stacktest.png)

Everything looks correct!

Next Steps
-------

At this point, I don't think I can put off working on the core interpreter any longer. Now that most of the auxilliary pieces are in place, I can go back to writing and testing my main Forth interpreter. The plan is to make sure calling dictionary words work correctly, populating the dictionary with words based on the stack functionality I've implemented thus far, and then working on a simple commandline REPL. After that, I'll technically have a working Forth interpreter...but we'll see how long it takes to get there.

As always, you can follow this project [on Github](https://github.com/ahl27/FORTH)!
