I finally got my shipment of resistors and soldering wicks, so it's time to complete the hardware build for this computer! Unfortunately header pins are numerous, and soldering wicks aren't *quite* as effective as I had hoped at removing solder. Fortunately I had plenty of extra parts, and PCBway's minimum PCB shipment is five boards, so I decided to start over from scratch. 

This time, I only had one issue: my variety pack of resistors didn't come with a 3.3kΩ resistor. What it did have, however, were plenty of 1kΩ resistors and 2.2kΩ resistors. 3.2kΩ with a tolerance of 5% is 3,040-3,460Ω, which is close enough to 3.3kΩ to make it work. I wired the resistors in series and put solder on the connection, forming a functional (albeit relatively messy) connection.

After that, all that was left was soldering in new pieces and sockets, this time with the pins in the right orientation! I also paid a little closer attention to the capacitors I soldered in--the writing is so tiny, it's easy to mistake a 103M for a 104M. On this iteration, we have correct capacitors in all the sockets, plus a nice new blue LED!

All that's left is to pop in the ICs, and voila.
